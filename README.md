Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is a Ricardo Gutiérrez submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files
CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
